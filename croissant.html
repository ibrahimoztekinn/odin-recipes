    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>An easy and impressive breakfast or brunch, this recipe is the perfect choice for special occasions or holidays. Serve warm with your favorite toppings.</p>
    <p>Some suggestions are powdered sugar, chopped nuts, cinnamon sugar, berries, maple syrup, blueberry or strawberry syrup, and whipped cream.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>4 large croissants, halved horizontally, left out overnight</li>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>½ cup half-and-half</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 pinch ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Whisk eggs, half-and-half, sugar, vanilla, cinnamon, salt, and nutmeg together in a shallow bowl. Dip each croissant half into the egg mixture, one at a time, flipping it and lightly pressing down, until well coated.</li>
        <li>Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat; add four croissant halves, cut side down. Fry until browned on both sides, turning once, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer to the oven to keep warm while you cook the remaining croissants.
        </li>
        <li>Serve warm with your favorite toppings.</li>
    </ol>

    <h5>Cook's Note:</h5>

        <p>It's important that the croissants are dry before dipping. As an alternative to leaving the croissants sit out overnight, you can place the sliced croissants on a baking sheet, and toast in the oven at 200 degrees F (95 degrees C) until dry, 12 to 15 minutes.
        Feel free to substitute almond milk or low-fat milk for the half and half.</p>
