    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Bring a light, smoky flavor to your oven-roasted chicken thighs without having to grill outdoors. The deep flavors pair well with a cucumber salad or garlic rice.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon smoked paprika</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon granulated garlic</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ancho chile powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>4 large bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons melted butter</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon cider vinegar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons minced fresh parsley (Optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease an 8x8-inch baking dish.</li>
        <li>In a large resealable storage bag, combine paprika, garlic, ancho chile powder, salt, turmeric, and black pepper; add olive oil and apple cider vinegar and mix together. Place chicken thighs into the bag, reseal, and massage seasoning mix into chicken. Marinate, refrigerated, for at least 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Place the chicken in the prepared baking dish and drizzle with melted butter.
        </li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the chicken is no longer pink inside and the skin is crispy, about 40 minutes, brushing occasionally with the pan drippings. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thick part of a thigh should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). For extra crispy skin, place under the broiler for 1 to 2 minutes. Garnish with parsley.</li>
    </ol>

    <h5>Cook's Note:</h5>

        <p>You may substitute regular chili powder for the ancho chile.</p>
